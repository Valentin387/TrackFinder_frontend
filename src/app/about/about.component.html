    <h3 class="features-heading" >Key Features:</h3>
    <ul class="features-list">
        <li >Search Songs: Flexible filtering based on various fields. The filters actually work as tags, they are accumulative, this was intended. </li>
        <li >List Collections: Retrieve a list of all collections in the database.</li>
        <li >Add Songs: Add a new song to a specified collection, with duplicate checks.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="context-heading" >Context:</h3>
    <p class="context-description" >How did all this start?</p>
    <p class="context-details" >I don't like to use Spotify, so I prefer manually selecting and downloading music. With at least 900 songs in multiple folders, I couldn't keep track of which songs were already in playlists. To solve this, I manually added metadata for all my songs (which was tedious), used my other project MusicToMetaData to extract metadata into JSON files for each folder, and uploaded these files to MongoDB Atlas. Now, I can check if any new song I like has already been added to a collection using this software.</p>
